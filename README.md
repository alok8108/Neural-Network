The project if for beginers in the PyTorch to understand the basics of PyTorch and how to create a simple linear model using the pytorch. 
The basics of loading the state dictionary of the model and loading it is also shown.
For understanding purpose the simple Mean value error loss function is used. Here by changing the no of epochs in 2 different training loops the effect of training on loss is shown.
